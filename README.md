NYC Food Inspection Results

The Health Department of New York conducts an inspection of all the food establishments every year and grades the restaurants. The restaurants are graded with grades A, B and C. When a customer visits a restaurant, the grade of the restaurant is ignored or the consumer is of the assumption that a restaurant with A grade are really good. But in reality, restaurants with A grade too have violations. Hence, the aim of this project is to provide users with a tool that provides more information than just the grade. 

We identified 3 major questions that our tool would answer, that would provide the user with much more information than just the grades of the restaurant. The questions are as follows:
- How do restaurant inspection results change over time? Are restaurants improving based on the given feedback?
- Are certain violations especially common in certain areas? Is there an area that is particularly susceptible to vermin based problems?
- What kind of restaurants (cuisines) suffer from certain kinds of violations and how it changed over time? Do bakeries have different problems from burger restaurants?

We have come up with a visualization tool that attempts to satisfactorily answer the above questions.
